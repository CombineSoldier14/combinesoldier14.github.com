## FAQ

**Q:** What is the inspiration for CombineBot's logo and branding?

**A:** His logos are all made by me and are the Half-Life 2 Combine symbol. As for the name, it's really just something I came up with in a pinch.

**Q:** Will CombineBot ever be paid or have a premium function?

**A:** Absolutely not. This kind of stuff should always be free and I do this out of fun and passion.

**Q:** When did I start working on CombineBot?

**A:** CombineBot's creation date is December 12, 2023, when I was staying up late trying to find a quick and easy way for me to make a bot without any coding experience and I stumbled upon BDFD. I entered my token into it and everything was done. CombineBot X was created on Feburary 11, 2024 when CombineBot hit 100 slash commands and I started the X series to continue his legacy.

**Q:** How is CombineBot hosted, and what methods did you use?

**A:** I host CombineBot at home via my Raspberry Pi 4! If my bot ever becomes popular I'll have to upgrade systems but I doubt that will happen anytime soon.



*On 4/8/2024 I discontinued the older BDScript CombineBots as CombineBot on pycord and D.JS was better and more efficent.*

If you are looking for the older BDScript CombineBots, they were discontinued in April 2024 and are no longer hosted. However, you can still look at their code and host them yourself via these BDFD share cods if you must.
