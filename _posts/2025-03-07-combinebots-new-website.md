title: "CombineBot's new website!"
---

Well, we are finally here.

An actual, *real* website for CombineBot. It has info, GIFs of the commands in action, and of course my signature old web style.

I also want to make a WebUI in the future for seeing stats on the leaderboard, seeing your own stats and maybe configuring things?? Really depends on what I want to add.

Visit https://combinebot.github.io!
