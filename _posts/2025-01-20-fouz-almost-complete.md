title: "CMBTeam's first level is nearing completion: FIRE OXYGEN ULTRA Z"
---

Hello everyone! Remember CMBTeam, that thing I keep advertising but never talk about? Well it's finally relevant. CMBTeam is my creating team and we have finished the gameplay and some deco for our first level, Fire Oxygen Ultra Z! It is a 1.6-1.9 styled fan made Ice Carbon series entry that has been in development hell for over a year now. Many people have left, many people have joined, but the level has finally came together. It is NOT DONE YET, but if you would like to see a rough showcase, here it is:

The level will (hopefully) be done by around April 2025 maybe but no promises. Thanks for reading and stay tuned for more updates.

**Edit: FOUZ will likely be finished by March 5th, 2025. However that is ONLY THE UNNERFED VERSION! The level might not actually be nerfed and verified until a few months later.  We don't really know at this point.**
